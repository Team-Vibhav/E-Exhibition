    "senso": "In the Senso project the sound of a logging machinery is identified by the device.The name of this project is Senso. Senso is a machine to detect nearby logging machinery sounds.This project detects nearby logging machinery sound. The cost required to build this project is Rs 9132. The technology used in this project is the EMD module sensor. The full form of EMD is Empirical Mode Decomposition. The aim of this project is to prevent illegal deforestation. The programming language used to build this project is Python. EMD module analyzes the sound signal detected by the device. Additional In this project we have created a tracker. The tracker would track the shipment of logs that are cut from trees. Fast Fourier transform is applied on the audio signal. Fast Fourier Transform is an algorithm that computes Discrete Fourier Transform. Frequency component of a sound is used to determine its similarity with other sounds. The use of Fast Fourier Transform converts a signal from its original domain to frequency domain.  The two audio signals are compared by correlating them in their frequency domain.  The computation of Fast Fourier transform is very fast and accurate. The materials required in this project are  Arduino MKR Fox   GPS Module  Antenna GPS GSM     DFRobot Audio Analyser Module . This project compares two signals by Correlation.In this project Correlation is a statistical measure.In this project Correlation expresses the linear relation between two variables. Correlation Coefficient is the numerical measure of Correlation. The demerit of this project is that it has short battery life. The project by the use of better materials can be made waterproof. The device takes new samples of sound every 15 minutes.  This device identifies sound by analysing audio signals in EMD module. Inside the EMD module a composite audio signal is compared with the sound of a logging machine. An audio composite signal is a signal made of various audio frequencies. The benefits of this project are that animal poaching and illegal deforestation can be reduced. The value of correlation coefficient of the audio signal containing chainsaw frequency is close to 1. The range of Correlation Coefficient is from 0 to 1. The device detects an analog signal. The Fast Fourier Transform is applied on a digital signal. An analog signal is converted to a digital signal via analog-to-digital converter. This project uses analog signal.This project can be used for animal poaching by detecting gunshot sound. Senso will be executed as follows at first we take sounds from surrounding and preprocess it While preprocessing we convert the time domain signal to frequency domain signal and then correlate it with our composite signal  Our composite signal is made up of sounds of chainsaw thus on correlating other signal’s that have components of chainsaw with our composite signal we get a value close to 1 Thus it shows that the component of chainsaw is available  If this value of correlation is close to 0 then it means it does not have a component of chainsaw Thus we can find the illegal logging of trees and confirm it.The future scope of this project is that we will make it on hardware using Raspberry pi and EMD module sensor and use GPS module for detecting location of illegal logging of tress. Things are working in this project as we are taking a sound and applying signal processing on it and using it to detect illegal logging of trees.An analog signal is converted to a digital signal via analog-to-digital converter.The Fast Fourier Transform is applied on a digital signal.It took approximately 4 weeks to build this project.The range of this project is 200 m.",
